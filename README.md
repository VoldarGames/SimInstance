# SimInstance
## Introduction
SimInstanceLab is a powerful tool that allows programmers to create lots of instances based on some rules.

    For example:

    ·This instance property must be on a Range or can be null or both
  
    ·This instance property is a foreign key of another type of instance
  
All this rules can be added in a fluent manner with profiles or directly added on your model domain with SimAttributes.

    Once you have create tons of randomly generated instances (based on your rules) you can:

    ·Redirect those instance list to pass your own UnitTests
  
    ·Export to JSON all instances
  
    ·Serialize instances into a file
